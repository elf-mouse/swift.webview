# Simple Universal Webview App

This is an Xcode 6 Universal project that allows you to wrap your website or web app in a super simple iOS app.

# Setup

### Local mode (recommended)

### Internet mode

# Why?

So you can build an iOS app in HTML/CSS/JS without using Cordova. 

HTML web apps are totally awesome for layout content and typography. Tons of big apps like Instagram use HTML layouts and CSS styling for parts of their apps.

If you are a web developer who wants to release an iOS app, this should help you cut some corners when it comes to learning Swift.

# Ideal use

Single page web app with on-screen/no navigation. For example, a game, interactive page, web based slideshow, etc.
